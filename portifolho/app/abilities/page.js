        <p><em>The holy trinity of Front-End development - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript - was my gateway into the world of programming. Through focused study and hands-on projects, I`ve steadily refined my skills and continue to learn every day, always striving to grow as a developer and create better, more engaging user experiencies</em></p>
        <p><em>Curious to explore the vast "metaverse" of Back-End development, I began my journey with Java -One of the most powerful and reliable programming languages out there. Through consistent study and hand-on projects, I`ve been building a solid foundation while sharpening both my knowledge and versatility.</em></p>
